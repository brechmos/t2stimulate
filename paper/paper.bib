  abstract = "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest non-traumatic disabling
              disease to affect young adults. The incidence of MS is increasing
              worldwide, together with the socioeconomic impact of the disease.
              The underlying cause of MS and mechanisms behind this increase
              remain opaque, although complex gene-environment interactions
              almost certainly play a significant role. The epidemiology of MS
              indicates that low serum levels of vitamin D, smoking, childhood
              obesity and infection with the Epstein-Barr virus are likely to
              play a role in disease development. Changes in diagnostic methods
              and criteria mean that people with MS can be diagnosed
              increasingly early in their disease trajectory. Alongside this,
              treatments for MS have increased exponentially in number,
              efficacy and risk. There is now the possibility of a diagnosis of
              'pre-symptomatic MS' being made; as a result potentially
              preventive strategies could be studied. In this comprehensive
              review, MS epidemiology, potential aetiological factors and
              pathology are discussed, before moving on to clinical aspects of
              MS diagnosis and management.",

              spin-spin relaxation time, T2, between water associated with
              myelin sheaths and water in other central nervous system tissue
              in order to measure myelin water content within any region of an
              image or to generate indirectly a myelin map of the brain. In
              normal volunteers, myelin water maps give the expected myelin
              distribution. In multiple sclerosis patients, lesions exhibit
              different myelin water contents providing insight into the
              demyelination process unavailable from conventional magnetic
              resonance images. In vivo myelin measurement has important
              applications in the clinical management of multiple sclerosis and
