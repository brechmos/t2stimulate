The software was written by myself based on Matlab code I had written in the 2000's.  The paper that inspired this
work was written by Hennig (Hennig J. Multiecho imaging sequences with low refocusing flip angles. J Magn Reson 1988; 78: 397–407)
that described how the spin-echoes and stimulated echoes propagated through an echo train.

The original software (simulation and fitting) were completed during my PhD and then written up in the publication
Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 67:1803–1814 (2012) (https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.23157).
